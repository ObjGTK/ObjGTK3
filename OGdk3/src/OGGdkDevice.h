 * is used for Drag and Drop operations, popup menus and such.
 * 
 * Note that if the event mask of an X window has selected both button press
 * and button release events, then a button press event will cause an automatic
 * pointer grab until the button is released. X does this automatically since
 * most applications expect to receive button press and release events in pairs.
 * It is equivalent to a pointer grab on the window with @owner_events set to
 * %TRUE.

 *                @event_mask. In either mode, unreported events are discarded.
