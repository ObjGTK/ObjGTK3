# ObjGTK3

Gtk3 bindings for Objective C utilizing ObjFW. These files are generated by objgtkgen - you can do it yourself.

This library set is meant to work with the versions delivered with Debian 11 Bullseye (Stable). If you've got
different library versions try to run the generator on your own. You will have to apply [small patches](https://codeberg.org/ObjGTK/ObjGTKGen/src/branch/main/Manual_library_fixes.md) then.

First install [OGObject](https://codeberg.org/ObjGTK/OGObject).

Then autogen, configure, make, make install in this order:

1. OGPango
2. OGGdkPixpuf
3. OGdk3
4. OGAtk
5. ObjGTK3

See [this Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/ObjGTK/ObjGTK3ExampleApp) repo for current usage and a small example app.
