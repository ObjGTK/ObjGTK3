/**
 * A GtkBuilder is an auxiliary object that reads textual descriptions
 * of a user interface and instantiates the described objects. To create
 * a GtkBuilder from a user interface description, call
 * gtk_builder_new_from_file(), gtk_builder_new_from_resource() or
 * gtk_builder_new_from_string().
 * 
 * In the (unusual) case that you want to add user interface
 * descriptions from multiple sources to the same GtkBuilder you can
 * call gtk_builder_new() to get an empty builder and populate it by
 * (multiple) calls to gtk_builder_add_from_file(),
 * gtk_builder_add_from_resource() or gtk_builder_add_from_string().
 * 
 * A GtkBuilder holds a reference to all objects that it has constructed
 * and drops these references when it is finalized. This finalization can
 * cause the destruction of non-widget objects or widgets which are not
 * contained in a toplevel window. For toplevel windows constructed by a
 * builder, it is the responsibility of the user to call gtk_widget_destroy()
 * to get rid of them and all the widgets they contain.
 * 
 * The functions gtk_builder_get_object() and gtk_builder_get_objects()
 * can be used to access the widgets in the interface by the names assigned
 * to them inside the UI description. Toplevel windows returned by these
 * functions will stay around until the user explicitly destroys them
 * with gtk_widget_destroy(). Other widgets will either be part of a
 * larger hierarchy constructed by the builder (in which case you should
 * not have to worry about their lifecycle), or without a parent, in which
 * case they have to be added to some container to make use of them.
 * Non-widget objects need to be reffed with g_object_ref() to keep them
 * beyond the lifespan of the builder.
 * 
 * The function gtk_builder_connect_signals() and variants thereof can be
 * used to connect handlers to the named signals in the description.
 * 
 * # GtkBuilder UI Definitions # {#BUILDER-UI}
 * 
 * GtkBuilder parses textual descriptions of user interfaces which are
 * specified in an XML format which can be roughly described by the
 * RELAX NG schema below. We refer to these descriptions as “GtkBuilder
 * UI definitions” or just “UI definitions” if the context is clear.
 * Do not confuse GtkBuilder UI Definitions with
 * [GtkUIManager UI Definitions][XML-UI], which are more limited in scope.
 * It is common to use `.ui` as the filename extension for files containing
 * GtkBuilder UI definitions.
 * 
 * [RELAX NG Compact Syntax](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/blob/gtk-3-24/gtk/gtkbuilder.rnc)
 * 
 * The toplevel element is <interface>. It optionally takes a “domain”
 * attribute, which will make the builder look for translated strings
 * using dgettext() in the domain specified. This can also be done by
 * calling gtk_builder_set_translation_domain() on the builder.
 * Objects are described by <object> elements, which can contain
 * <property> elements to set properties, <signal> elements which
 * connect signals to handlers, and <child> elements, which describe
 * child objects (most often widgets inside a container, but also e.g.
 * actions in an action group, or columns in a tree model). A <child>
 * element contains an <object> element which describes the child object.
 * The target toolkit version(s) are described by <requires> elements,
 * the “lib” attribute specifies the widget library in question (currently
 * the only supported value is “gtk+”) and the “version” attribute specifies
 * the target version in the form “<major>.<minor>”. The builder will error
 * out if the version requirements are not met.
 * 
 * Typically, the specific kind of object represented by an <object>
 * element is specified by the “class” attribute. If the type has not
 * been loaded yet, GTK+ tries to find the get_type() function from the
 * class name by applying heuristics. This works in most cases, but if
 * necessary, it is possible to specify the name of the get_type() function
 * explictly with the "type-func" attribute. As a special case, GtkBuilder
 * allows to use an object that has been constructed by a #GtkUIManager in
 * another part of the UI definition by specifying the id of the #GtkUIManager
 * in the “constructor” attribute and the name of the object in the “id”
 * attribute.
 * 
 * Objects may be given a name with the “id” attribute, which allows the
 * application to retrieve them from the builder with gtk_builder_get_object().
 * An id is also necessary to use the object as property value in other
 * parts of the UI definition. GTK+ reserves ids starting and ending
 * with ___ (3 underscores) for its own purposes.
 * 
 * Setting properties of objects is pretty straightforward with the
 * <property> element: the “name” attribute specifies the name of the
 * property, and the content of the element specifies the value.
 * If the “translatable” attribute is set to a true value, GTK+ uses
 * gettext() (or dgettext() if the builder has a translation domain set)
 * to find a translation for the value. This happens before the value
 * is parsed, so it can be used for properties of any type, but it is
 * probably most useful for string properties. It is also possible to
 * specify a context to disambiguate short strings, and comments which
 * may help the translators.
 * 
 * GtkBuilder can parse textual representations for the most common
 * property types: characters, strings, integers, floating-point numbers,
 * booleans (strings like “TRUE”, “t”, “yes”, “y”, “1” are interpreted
 * as %TRUE, strings like “FALSE”, “f”, “no”, “n”, “0” are interpreted
 * as %FALSE), enumerations (can be specified by their name, nick or
 * integer value), flags (can be specified by their name, nick, integer
 * value, optionally combined with “|”, e.g. “GTK_VISIBLE|GTK_REALIZED”)
 * and colors (in a format understood by gdk_rgba_parse()).
 * 
 * GVariants can be specified in the format understood by g_variant_parse(),
 * and pixbufs can be specified as a filename of an image file to load.
 * 
 * Objects can be referred to by their name and by default refer to
 * objects declared in the local xml fragment and objects exposed via
 * gtk_builder_expose_object(). In general, GtkBuilder allows forward
 * references to objects — declared in the local xml; an object doesn’t
 * have to be constructed before it can be referred to. The exception
 * to this rule is that an object has to be constructed before it can
 * be used as the value of a construct-only property.
 * 
 * It is also possible to bind a property value to another object's
 * property value using the attributes
 * "bind-source" to specify the source object of the binding,
 * "bind-property" to specify the source property and optionally
 * "bind-flags" to specify the binding flags.
 * Internally builder implements this using GBinding objects.
 * For more information see g_object_bind_property()
 * 
 * Signal handlers are set up with the <signal> element. The “name”
 * attribute specifies the name of the signal, and the “handler” attribute
 * specifies the function to connect to the signal. By default, GTK+ tries
 * to find the handler using g_module_symbol(), but this can be changed by
 * passing a custom #GtkBuilderConnectFunc to
 * gtk_builder_connect_signals_full(). The remaining attributes, “after”,
 * “swapped” and “object”, have the same meaning as the corresponding
 * parameters of the g_signal_connect_object() or
 * g_signal_connect_data() functions. A “last_modification_time”
 * attribute is also allowed, but it does not have a meaning to the
 * builder.
 * 
 * Sometimes it is necessary to refer to widgets which have implicitly
 * been constructed by GTK+ as part of a composite widget, to set
 * properties on them or to add further children (e.g. the @vbox of
 * a #GtkDialog). This can be achieved by setting the “internal-child”
 * property of the <child> element to a true value. Note that GtkBuilder
 * still requires an <object> element for the internal child, even if it
 * has already been constructed.
 * 
 * A number of widgets have different places where a child can be added
 * (e.g. tabs vs. page content in notebooks). This can be reflected in
 * a UI definition by specifying the “type” attribute on a <child>
 * The possible values for the “type” attribute are described in the
 * sections describing the widget-specific portions of UI definitions.
 * 
 * # A GtkBuilder UI Definition
 * 
 * |[
 * <interface>
 *   <object class="GtkDialog" id="dialog1">
 *     <child internal-child="vbox">
 *       <object class="GtkBox" id="vbox1">
 *         <property name="border-width">10</property>
 *         <child internal-child="action_area">
 *           <object class="GtkButtonBox" id="hbuttonbox1">
 *             <property name="border-width">20</property>
 *             <child>
 *               <object class="GtkButton" id="ok_button">
 *                 <property name="label">gtk-ok</property>
 *                 <property name="use-stock">TRUE</property>
 *                 <signal name="clicked" handler="ok_button_clicked"/>
 *               </object>
 *             </child>
 *           </object>
 *         </child>
 *       </object>
 *     </child>
 *   </object>
 * </interface>
 * ]|
 * 
 * Beyond this general structure, several object classes define their
 * own XML DTD fragments for filling in the ANY placeholders in the DTD
 * above. Note that a custom element in a <child> element gets parsed by
 * the custom tag handler of the parent object, while a custom element in
 * an <object> element gets parsed by the custom tag handler of the object.
 * 
 * These XML fragments are explained in the documentation of the
 * respective objects.
 * 
 * Additionally, since 3.10 a special <template> tag has been added
 * to the format allowing one to define a widget class’s components.
 * See the [GtkWidget documentation][composite-templates] for details.
