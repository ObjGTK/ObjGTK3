/**
 * A GtkFileFilter can be used to restrict the files being shown in a
 * #GtkFileChooser. Files can be filtered based on their name (with
 * gtk_file_filter_add_pattern()), on their mime type (with
 * gtk_file_filter_add_mime_type()), or by a custom filter function
 * (with gtk_file_filter_add_custom()).
 * 
 * Filtering by mime types handles aliasing and subclassing of mime
 * types; e.g. a filter for text/plain also matches a file with mime
 * type application/rtf, since application/rtf is a subclass of
 * text/plain. Note that #GtkFileFilter allows wildcards for the
 * subtype of a mime type, so you can e.g. filter for image/\*.
 * 
 * Normally, filters are used by adding them to a #GtkFileChooser,
 * see gtk_file_chooser_add_filter(), but it is also possible
 * to manually use a filter on a file with gtk_file_filter_filter().
 * 
 * # GtkFileFilter as GtkBuildable
 * 
 * The GtkFileFilter implementation of the GtkBuildable interface
 * supports adding rules using the <mime-types>, <patterns> and
 * <applications> elements and listing the rules within. Specifying
 * a <mime-type> or <pattern> has the same effect as as calling
 * gtk_file_filter_add_mime_type() or gtk_file_filter_add_pattern().
 * 
 * An example of a UI definition fragment specifying GtkFileFilter
 * rules:
 * |[
 * <object class="GtkFileFilter">
 *   <mime-types>
 *     <mime-type>text/plain</mime-type>
 *     <mime-type>image/ *</mime-type>
 *   </mime-types>
 *   <patterns>
 *     <pattern>*.txt</pattern>
 *     <pattern>*.png</pattern>
 *   </patterns>
 * </object>
 * ]|
