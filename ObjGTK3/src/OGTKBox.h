/**
 * The GtkBox widget arranges child widgets into a single row or column,
 * depending upon the value of its #GtkOrientable:orientation property. Within
 * the other dimension, all children are allocated the same size. Of course,
 * the #GtkWidget:halign and #GtkWidget:valign properties can be used on
 * the children to influence their allocation.
 * 
 * GtkBox uses a notion of packing. Packing refers
 * to adding widgets with reference to a particular position in a
 * #GtkContainer. For a GtkBox, there are two reference positions: the
 * start and the end of the box.
 * For a vertical #GtkBox, the start is defined as the top of the box and
 * the end is defined as the bottom. For a horizontal #GtkBox the start
 * is defined as the left side and the end is defined as the right side.
 * 
 * Use repeated calls to gtk_box_pack_start() to pack widgets into a
 * GtkBox from start to end. Use gtk_box_pack_end() to add widgets from
 * end to start. You may intersperse these calls and add widgets from
 * both ends of the same GtkBox.
 * 
 * Because GtkBox is a #GtkContainer, you may also use gtk_container_add()
 * to insert widgets into the box, and they will be packed with the default
 * values for expand and fill child properties. Use gtk_container_remove()
 * to remove widgets from the GtkBox.
 * 
 * Use gtk_box_set_homogeneous() to specify whether or not all children
 * of the GtkBox are forced to get the same amount of space.
 * 
 * Use gtk_box_set_spacing() to determine how much space will be
 * minimally placed between all children in the GtkBox. Note that
 * spacing is added between the children, while
 * padding added by gtk_box_pack_start() or gtk_box_pack_end() is added
 * on either side of the widget it belongs to.
 * 
 * Use gtk_box_reorder_child() to move a GtkBox child to a different
 * place in the box.
 * 
 * Use gtk_box_set_child_packing() to reset the expand,
 * fill and padding child properties.
 * Use gtk_box_query_child_packing() to query these fields.
 * 
 * # CSS nodes
 * 
 * GtkBox uses a single CSS node with name box.
 * 
 * In horizontal orientation, the nodes of the children are always arranged
 * from left to right. So :first-child will always select the leftmost child,
 * regardless of text direction.
