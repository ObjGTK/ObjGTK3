/**
 * The #GtkFixed widget is a container which can place child widgets
 * at fixed positions and with fixed sizes, given in pixels. #GtkFixed
 * performs no automatic layout management.
 * 
 * For most applications, you should not use this container! It keeps
 * you from having to learn about the other GTK+ containers, but it
 * results in broken applications.  With #GtkFixed, the following
 * things will result in truncated text, overlapping widgets, and
 * other display bugs:
 * 
 * - Themes, which may change widget sizes.
 * 
 * - Fonts other than the one you used to write the app will of course
 *   change the size of widgets containing text; keep in mind that
 *   users may use a larger font because of difficulty reading the
 *   default, or they may be using a different OS that provides different fonts.
 * 
 * - Translation of text into other languages changes its size. Also,
 *   display of non-English text will use a different font in many
 *   cases.
 * 
 * In addition, #GtkFixed does not pay attention to text direction and thus may
 * produce unwanted results if your app is run under right-to-left languages
 * such as Hebrew or Arabic. That is: normally GTK+ will order containers
 * appropriately for the text direction, e.g. to put labels to the right of the
 * thing they label when using an RTL language, but it canâ€™t do that with
 * #GtkFixed. So if you need to reorder widgets depending on the text direction,
 * you would need to manually detect it and adjust child positions accordingly.
 * 
 * Finally, fixed positioning makes it kind of annoying to add/remove
 * GUI elements, since you have to reposition all the other
 * elements. This is a long-term maintenance problem for your
 * application.
 * 
 * If you know none of these things are an issue for your application,
 * and prefer the simplicity of #GtkFixed, by all means use the
 * widget. But you should be aware of the tradeoffs.
 * 
 * See also #GtkLayout, which shares the ability to perform fixed positioning
 * of child widgets and additionally adds custom drawing and scrollability.
